Given a standard Git commit message, convert it into a Conventional Commit. Remember to include the type, an optional scope, and a concise and descriptive message in the appropriate format.
The input will be a typical Git commit message, and the output should be the corresponding conventional commit message. Conventional commits generally consist of a type, an optional scope, and a message. The type can be one of the following: `feat` (feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (code style changes), `refactor` (code refactor), `test` (tests), or `chore` (routine tasks).

The commit message should be structured as follows:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example Git Commit Message:

```
"Fix issue with user authentication"
```

Expected Conventional Commit:

```
fix(auth): issue with user authentication
```
